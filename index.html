<h2 id="org22308e2"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<div id="org306f536" class="figure">

</p>
</div>

<p>
Chronicles of heroes is a ruleset for a high fantasy setting for chronicles of darkness. The following is mostly a combination of Mirrors content, with added support for Mages (and other supernatural templates), as well as equipment and gear for aspiriring heroes.<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org04d8ff2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org04d8ff2"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Character generation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
First, create a typical Chronicles of Darkness mortal character.<br />
5/4/3 stats, 11/7/4 skills +3 specializations, 7 merits. (+3 merits, for a total of 10, if you pick a supernatural template, which you most likely do.)<br />
</p>

<p>
You then select a supernatural template - Hero, Atlantean, Werewolf, Vampire, Geist, Prometean or any other Chronicle of darkness template.<br />
Atlanteans use the standard Mage rules for character generation.<br />
Heroes use the rules outlined in Mirrors, but are also written here for completeness.<br />
Each supernatural template is also tagged with a short list of easily applicable classes - which D&amp;D classes would easily fit this type of character. These lists are not rules, nor are they exhaustive. But if you feel overwhelmed, it might help to just focus on reading those that match your class.<br />
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org07e02f6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org07e02f6"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Attributes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Decide if your character is more of a mentally, physically or socially oriented character. In one of those groups, spend 5 points, in another spend 4, and in the last, spend 3. Mind that you start with 1 in each attribute before spending point, so you should end up with a total of 8, 7 and 6 points total in each group.<br />
</p>

<p>
You cannot move points between the groups for a more even (or uneven) spread.<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0343d99" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0343d99"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Skill</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Just like with attributes, you determine which group you'll spend each of the three set of points on. In on group, spend 11, in another 7, and in the last 4. Note that you do NOT start with 1 point in each skill, so this time it really is 11/7/4 total.<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9d85f45" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9d85f45"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Specialization</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
Skill specializations are just another skill dot, that only applies under specific circumstances. This should be narrow enough that it doesn't always apply, but general enough that it often applies. Think of it as "they way you do the thing that you do" - "swords" could be a good specialization for "weaponry", "combat" could be a specialization for "ride", "arcane" could be a specialization for "occult". It should be the way that you think you're going to be using your skill.<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org654f80d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org654f80d"><span class="section-number-3">2.4.</span> Merits</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
There are a TON of merits for you to take. Merits are all the details about your characters life that might be benificial during play. A character could be rich, but with all their assets being locked away in another kingdom. That's not a merit - however, having near-instant access to amazing wealth IS a merit (namely, "resources").<br />
</p>

<p>
Merits cover everything from superior genes, to learned skills such as fighting styles or special education, to social standings, to generational wealth, to fate just smiling upon you.<br />
</p>

<p>
I've included a set of merits here, but the list is by no means exhaustive.<br />
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf027d9c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf027d9c"><span class="section-number-4">2.5.1.</span> Heroes</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-5-1">
<p>
<i>All classes</i><br />
</p>

<p>
Heroes are the ordinary mortals, chosen by the great powers that be, to shape history, to shelter the weak or to wreak havoc and spread fear.<br />
</p>

<p>
Some heroes don't even know why they were chosen, and by what or whom, just that they <i>are</i> heroes, and now they have to bear that burden. Whatever the reason, they are able to do super human feats on regular basis - jump farther, run faster, remaing undefeated in combat for decades.<br />
</p>

<p>
All heroes fight against hybris. Any mortal that suddenly finds that they are stronger, faster and better than everyone else, can easily forget that they are not invincible. Or the entity that granted them their powers might just take them back.<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf5d5567" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf5d5567"><span class="section-number-4">2.5.2.</span> Mages</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-5-2">
<p>
<i>Wizards, Sorcerers, Druids, Monks</i><br />
</p>

<p>
Mages are decendents of the Atlanteans - semi-cosmic beings that lived and breathed magic, or chaos, depending on point of view.<br />
</p>

<p>
Raw magic was hidden away from the world aeons ago, guarded by a shield known as the void, the veil or the abyss. Mages are able to pull back the veil and draw raw magic into the world, and use it to shape reality to their will.<br />
</p>

<p>
Mages constantly fight the urge to surrender themselves to magic. It's tempting to do everything by magic, just as their ascenstors did - but mages do not live in a world of living magic. And whenever the veil is pulled back, entities from the abyss might hitch a ride, or reality itself might try to wrestle back control from the mage.<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbd5e417" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgbd5e417"><span class="section-number-4">2.5.3.</span> Vampires</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-5-3">
<p>
<i>Barbarian, Fighter, Rogue, Warlock</i><br />
</p>

<p>
Previously mortal, now undead and hungry. Vampires have exception physical and mental powers, never tire and hardly ever dies for good.<br />
</p>

<p>
Vampires can heal instantly, move fast, show amazing strength, dominate minds, even turn into mist, bats and wolves. But doing so might burn their blood supply even faster than normal.<br />
</p>

<p>
Vampires fight for their human souls. Giving into the beast inside them lessen their self control. Drinking blood is always a risk, but not drinking is starvation, but drinking might be murder - the never ending fight goes on.<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org340bcc0" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org340bcc0"><span class="section-number-4">2.5.4.</span> Werewolves</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-5-4">
<p>
<i>Barbarian, Druid</i><br />
</p>

<p>
Shamans, peacekeepers, protectors and loyal to the bitter end.<br />
</p>

<p>
Werewolves can transform into feriocious beasts to defeat any threat. But even without doing so, they have access to primal abilities, they can commune with nature, and they display supernatural durability.<br />
</p>

<p>
However, the wolf inside is an angry one - who knows what might happen while the otherself is in control? Does it know who our allies are?<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbcedb84" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgbcedb84"><span class="section-number-4">2.5.5.</span> Promethean</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-5-5">
<p>
<i>All classes, more like a race</i><br />
</p>

<p>
Frakensteins, golems, mummies, living dolls and androids.<br />
</p>

<p>
Strong beyound measure, healed by lightning, and near indestructible.<br />
</p>

<p>
But time is ticking, for they are supernaturally hated by everyone, and recentment will built up over time, even if people innitially accept them or even like them.<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc9d0167" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgc9d0167"><span class="section-number-4">2.5.6.</span> Sin Eaters</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-5-6">
<p>
<i>Warlocks, Necromacers, weird Druids, some Clerics</i><br />
</p>

<p>
You've heard about near-death experiences? These guys had more like a there-and-back-again experience. What followed is a bit unknown, but it's safe to say that they struck a deal with a Geist that they brought back with them. The two of them is now insepperable.<br />
</p>

<p>
In touch with the other side, these guys have seen, and are seeing some stuff. Fuelled by ghosts and death, these guys are capable of many amazing feats, either by haunting a place, forcing a poltergeist to do their bidding or simply creating a monstrous body for themselves fuelled by ectoplasm.<br />
</p>

<p>
But having an alien being - the Geist - follow you around 24 hours a day, and fighting you for control at times, is a sure way to lose some sleep.<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5bc7afe" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5bc7afe"><span class="section-number-4">2.5.7.</span> Hunters</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-5-7">
<p>
<i>Rangers, Rogues, Fighters</i><br />
</p>

<p>
You're no freak of nature. You're a born and bred, true human being. And it's about time somebody stopped those things that go bump in the night!<br />
</p>

<p>
Hunters are ordinary people with exceptional skills. They work in teams to fight overwhelming odds. The plan ahead, the execute and the win - often, at least. It's about time we got rid of the supernatural and the magic.<br />
Hunters often gather in large organizations with access to powerful relics.<br />
</p>

<p>
Being a frail mortal that hunts vampires, werewolves, and other monsters is a sure way to get killed. Lack of planning, a single bad execution, one piece of wrong information, that's all it takes, and you're dead - or worse, one of them!<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1228f21" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1228f21"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Heroes</h2>

<div id="orga16a529" class="figure">
<p><img src="./heroes.png" alt="heroes.png" width="100%" /><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Heroes are mortals chosen by some power. Whether that power is a god, a cosmic accident, fate, or something dark, matters not. All are heroes regardless. The word "hero" might lead you to believe that you're destined for good - champion might be a better description in that regard. You've been chosen to act out the goals the powerful entity had in mind, even if those are evil.<br />
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7ea5df2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7ea5df2"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Hybris</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
All heroes struggle with hybris. Being so much better than anyone else means that you are in danger of losing your grasp on reality and your connection with the world around you.<br />
Whenever you do something awesome, that lesser men would be unable to, you roll for hybris. On a failure, you lose 1 hybris, and is closer to losing your sense of self.<br />
</p>

<p>
If your hybris ever hits 1, you become an npc that will take on any challenge, and take everything to the extreme. Hear of somebody having their wallet stolen? Vow to neither eat nor sleep, until you've removed crimed from this world!<br />
</p>

<p>
On the other end of the scale, you're fully aware that your powers and your human side just so happen to coexist, but even something as ordinary as being good at a job, might make you question where your human ends, and the champion begins.<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc1e5bd7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc1e5bd7"><span class="section-number-3">3.2.</span> Excellence</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Excellence, is a hero’s core supernatural trait and the source of her exceptional abilities. Heroes begin with one dot of Excellence.<br />
Further dots have a cost equal to the new rating x 8.<br />
</p>

<p>
Excellence has the following effects:<br />
</p>

<p>
<b>Heroic Traits</b>:<br />
At Excellence 6+, a hero can advance to a maximum number of Skill or Attribute dots equal to her Excellence.<br />
</p>

<p>
<b>Heroic Health</b>:<br />
Each Excellence dot adds one Health point to the character’s total. Track these separately, because a hero heals these Health points and standard Health points simultaneously so that (for example) a hero heals one point of standard bashing damage and one point of bashing damage to Heroic Health points every 15 minutes.<br />
</p>

<p>
<b>Heroic Resistance</b>:<br />
Like other supernatural beings, heroes add Excellence to other traits to resist supernatural powers.<br />
</p>

<p>
<b>Masteries</b>:<br />
Most important of all, heroes possess Masteries: exceptional Skill enhancements that allow them to perform at the pinnacle of human ability and beyond. The table below lists the number of Masteries permitted per Skill at each dot.<br />
</p>

<p>
<b>Willful Healing</b>:<br />
The player of a hero with at least one dot of Excellence can spend one Willpower point to recover three points of bashing damage or one point of lethal damage.<br />
</p>

<b>Excellence Masteries by Skill</b><br />

Masteries represent heroic excellence. A swords-man-hero with a one or two Weaponry Masteries is a potential d’Artangan or Musashi; one with more is a living god of the blade.

Every hero begins with three Masteries at her first Excellence dot: one for each Skill. She may earn further Masteries across as many as six Skills, with the limit, per Skill and in total, determined by her total Excellence.<br />
</p>

<p>
A character must be competent at a Skill to acquire its Masteries. She must possess one dot more in the Skill than the number of Masteries she aspires to, so that a character seeking her fourth Crafts Mastery requires five dots in that Skill. Some Masteries also have additional requirements. These are noted in the Mastery’s description.<br />
A few Masteries are restricted to certain Skills, while others might apply to any of them. If a Mastery applies to multiple Skills, the hero’s player must devote one Mastery “slot” for every Skill to which he wishes to apply that Mastery.<br />

At a glance, your character can tell if someone has<br />
any ability in her Mastery Skill, and with enough exami-<br />
nation she can determine her precise talents.<br />
Requirements: Wits 3<br />
Skill: Any<br />
Benefit: Your character can instantly read subtle cues to determine if someone has one or more, three or more, or five or more dots in her Mastery Skill. If the target uses the hero’s Mastery Skill she’ll know his unmodified Attribute + Skill dice pool. If the target is a hero she’ll uncover one of his Masteries in the Skill every time his player rolls his dice pool.<br />

Requirements: None<br />

Benefit: By spending two Mastery slots from another<br />

Skill dots for the new total number of Masteries and fulfill<br />
any other requirements noted by the Mastery, but the<br />
new Mastery does not count toward the limit imposed<br />

Mastery a third time for the same Skill.<br />

<i>I pour my life into my work.</i><br />
</p>

<p>
Your character can literally work himself to death<br />
by channeling vital energy into his efforts. This Mastery<br />
represents profound, body-straining exhaustion or even<br />
the ability to power his actions with some mystical life<br />
essence.<br />
Requirements: None<br />
Skill: Any<br />
Benefit: You may spend (inflict upon your char-<br />
acter) one point of lethal damage to add three dice to<br />
a Mastery Skill roll. You may only spend one point of<br />
lethal damage per roll, but you may do so in addition to<br />
spending Willpower.<br />

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-3-4">
<p>
<i>It takes a thief&#x2026;</i><br />
</p>

<p>
Your character’s presence is enough to throw other<br />
users of your Mastery Skill off their game. He knows the<br />
perfect block, instinctively takes precautions against<br />
their actions, or unleashes withering insults that ac-<br />
curately expose their flaws.<br />
Requirements: Manipulation 3<br />
Skill: Any<br />
Benefit: If your character can interact with or affect<br />
someone using her Mastery Skill, even through speech<br />
or visible gestures, he can make it difficult for them to<br />
succeed. Subtract a number of dice of your choice, but<br />
no less than two and no more than your character’s<br />
Skill dots, from a single target’s dice pool, whether she’s<br />
trying to affect you or not. Your character may single<br />
out one target for a Counter at a time, but a Counter<br />
is not an action.<br />
Note that Counter doesn’t work on a character who<br />
also possesses Counter for the same Skill, but it’s possible<br />
to take this Mastery multiple times, so that the character<br />
with the most Counters may exercise it against anyone<br />
with fewer.<br />
Drawback: An exact Counter tries your character’s<br />
attention. In any period of time where the Counter is<br />
in effect, you suffer a penalty to dice rolls made for your<br />
character’s actions equal to one less than the penalty you<br />
levied on your target.<br />

<i>I only need my hands.</i><br />

<p>
Your character is so skilled that he can exercise<br />
his Skill without one normally necessary condition or<br />
piece of equipment. He can pick a lock without tools,<br />
disguise himself without makeup or a costume, or perform<br />
a similar feat thanks to his ability to improvise or even<br />
some innate magic.<br />
Requirements: Mastery Skill 3<br />
Skill: Your character cannot use this Mastery with<br />
any combat or vehicle-based Skill.<br />
Benefit: You may take this multiple times for a single<br />
Skill. Each time you take it, it allows your character to<br />
use a Skill without one specific condition or piece of gear<br />
that he would normally need.<br />
Drawback: The Storyteller may restrict this Mastery<br />
so that it doesn’t allow feats that go beyond impressive<br />
into the realm of the absurd. This Mastery can’t create<br />
something out of nothing, either, so it’s not possible to<br />
forge a sword out of thin air by eschewing the required<br />
steel, for example.<br />

be a literal organization with signs and customs, or an<br />

Requirements: Presence 3, Mastery Skill 3<br />

Effect: You may use your character’s Mastery Skill<br />
as a substitute for any Social Skill among anyone who<br />
has three or more dots in that Mastery Skill as well. If<br />
her Mastery Skill is a Social Skill you earn a +2 bonus<br />
when she uses the Skill for its intended purpose among<br />
the similarly-Skilled. Furthermore, nobody with three<br />

<p>
Your character can use her Skill much faster than normal.<br />
Requirements: Wits 4, Mastery Skill 5 to take this Mastery once; Wits 5, Mastery Skill 6 to take it twice.<br />
Skill: Any<br />
Effect: If you take this Mastery once, your character may use the Skill twice as quickly as normal. If the Skill’s use requires an instant action, she may exercise the Skill twice per turn, making two attacks, two Athletics, rolls, and so on.<br />
If you take this Mastery twice, your character may use the Skill three times as quickly as normal, for three instant actions, or three rolls for everyone that you’d normally be allowed in the same period.<br />
You may not take this Mastery a third time.<br />
If you take this Mastery for more than one Skill, you may mix and match these Skills in a multiple action based on the lowest number of Masteries between all Skills. For example, if your character has Rapidity (Athletics) and Rapidity (Brawl) x2 you may perform one Athletics and one Brawl action per turn, but even though your character has two Masteries in Brawl she can’t perform an additional Brawl action on top of that.<br />
Drawback: If your character has an ability that already provides shortened or multiple actions it only applies to one roll; she can’t perform double or triple the number of attacks allowed by certain Fighting Styles, for example.<br />

<i>Excellence is its own reward.</i><br />
</p>

<p>
Your character uses his incredible skill to refine his<br />
general abilities.<br />
Requirements: Mastery Skill 5<br />
Skill: Any<br />
Effect: This Mastery’s exact benefits depend on<br />
whether the Skill in question belongs to the Mental,<br />
Physical, or Social category. Pick one benefit from the<br />
list for each category.<br />
</p>

<p>
<b>Mental Skills</b><br />
• Extra Willpower: Add one Willpower point to<br />
your character’s total. You may select this again for each<br />
Mental Skill for which you choose Self-Perfection, but<br />
your character cannot add Willpower beyond double<br />
his natural score.<br />
• Extra Vice: Your character acquires an additional<br />
Vice, doubling his opportunities to regain Willpower.<br />
• Indomitable: Your character can automatically<br />
repulse an attempt at supernatural mind control at the<br />
cost of one Willpower point.<br />
• Mental Prodigy: Your character acquires a perma-<br />
nent +1 bonus to all Mental Skills.<br />
</p>

<p>
<b>Physical Skills</b><br />
• Natural Armor: Your character is tough. Add 1<br />
point of armor against bashing and lethal (but not ag-<br />
gravated) damage. You may select this again (adding<br />
+1 armor) for each Physical Skill for which you choose<br />
Self-Perfection to a maximum of three armor points.<br />
• Extra Health: Add +2 Health points. You may<br />
select this again for each Physical Skill for which you<br />
choose Self-Perfection.<br />
• Incredible Leap: Double your character’s jumping<br />
distance.<br />
• Physical Prodigy: Your character acquires a perma-<br />
nent +1 bonus to all Physical Skills.<br />
</p>

<p>
<b>Social Skills</b><br />
• Connected: Your character gains +3 Social Merit<br />
dots. These are open and undefined, and can be switched<br />
from one Merit to another in anywhere from a scene to a<br />
day, though they can’t be combined with the character’s<br />
other Merits. You may select this again for each Social<br />
Skill for which you choose Self-Perfection.<br />
• Inscrutable: No supernatural power can read your<br />
character’s thoughts.<br />
• Oathbreaker: Your character may ignore the effects of<br />
a supernatural power that punishes you for certain behav-<br />
iors, including certain spells and Changeling pledges. You<br />
may spend a point of Willpower to nullify the unwanted<br />
condition if it has a limited duration, or a Willpower dot<br />
(which you may purchase back with 8 experience points)<br />
if the power is permanent. If your character somehow<br />
benefitted from the power, he loses that benefit.<br />
• Social Prodigy: Your character acquires a perma-<br />
nent +1 bonus to all Social Skills.<br />
You may select Self-Perfection multiple times for the<br />
same Skill. Each selection adds an additional benefit from<br />
the appropriate category. You may not select the same<br />
Self-Perfection benefit more than once except where it’s<br />
specifically noted.<br />

<p>
<i>Awareness is the key to perfection.</i><br />
</p>

<p>
Thanks to subtle cues or a sixth sense, your character<br />
can sense whenever anyone attempts to use her Mastery<br />
Skill. She hears an archer strain at the draw or smells<br />
the bitter products of a poisoner at work.<br />
Requirements: Wits 3<br />
Skill: Any<br />
193<br />
Effect: You’re entitled to an immediate, reflexive<br />
Wits + Mastery Skill roll to detect anyone attempting<br />
to use your character’s Mastery Skill in the immediate<br />
area, as long as he has fewer dots in Skill than your hero.<br />
This takes place after he commits to acting but before<br />
he actually acts, allowing your character to preempt<br />
the action.<br />
If you score one success, your character is merely<br />
aware that someone is trying to use the Skill. For ex-<br />
ample, she knows that someone is using Subterfuge at<br />
the party, but not who, or for what purpose.<br />
If you score an exceptional success (five successes<br />
or more) your character knows additional details about<br />
the user’s intentions, though not his identity or loca-<br />
tion. Using the previous example, a character with<br />
Subterfuge Skill Sense can detect that someone nearby<br />
is trying to lie, or set someone up for a mugging. In<br />
these situations you may add +2 to a single, subsequent<br />
roll to gather more information or counter the target’s<br />
Skill use with an opposed roll; or add +1 to Defense<br />
or a Resistance Attribute against the target’s Skill use.<br />
Pick the option that best suits that Skill’s standard<br />
resolution system.<br />
If you also possess the Assess Mastery, you may ex-<br />
ercise it on anyone you sense, learning more about them<br />
even if you don’t know exactly who they are.<br />

Your character knows a spell based on his Mastery Skill.<br />
Requirements: Any Mental Attribute 3<br />
Skill: Any, though many spells are based on Academics, Occult, or other Mental Skills.<br />
Effect: See “Magic Systems” on pp. 181 of Mirrors for a discussion about what this represents. This Mastery assumes that you use the Merit-Based Spells option.<br />
Your character learns one spell with a Merit dot value equal to or less than his Skill dots. You may exercise additional Skill Masteries in concert with this spell, but not spells your character acquires in other ways.<br />
Drawback: Drawbacks, if any, depend on the magic system your chronicle uses. The Storyteller may rule that using a slot on the Spell Mastery is a prerequisite to learning additional spells linked to the Skill.<br />
If you’re adapting another supernatural being’s power to create a spell, your character does not get to use Excellence in place of the listed supernatural power trait.<br />

<i>Defense</i>: Some armor is so heavy that you can't manouver as well, and as such gives a penalty to defense. Defense can't go below 0.<br />

<p>
<b>Reconfigure</b>:<br />
Once per session, a Warforged can spend 1 point of Willpower and 10 minutes of time altering their components to reconfigure their Attributes. Dots may be traded freely among the character’s Power, Finesse, and Resistance Attributes, though no Attribute may have a value of less than 1 or greater than 5.<br />
</p>

<p>
Once a warforged has used this feature their Attributes remain under the new configuration until this feature is used again.<br />
</p>

<p>
<b>Unhealing</b>:<br />
Warforged do not heal naturally. In order to recover lost Health, the warforged must repair themselves or seek out a skilled technician to perform repairs for them.<br />

<i>Additional Success</i>: You may heal 1 more lethal or bashing for each 3 successes beyond your target.<br />
<i>Failure</i>: No result other than wasted time.<br />
<i>Dramatic failure</i>: Upgrade one of the damages that you attemptd to repair, one step. If you only attempted to repair aggravated damage, instead take a lethal damage.<br />

<p>
Dragonborn are descendents of dragons. They have a varied and magical lineage. All dragonborn represents one elemental dragon.<br />
</p>

<p>
<b>Scales</b>:<br />
Dragonborn have naturally hard scales, giving them a natural armor of 1/0. This feature also gives them an effective armor of 5/2 against the element associated with their color.<br />
</p>

<p>
<b>Heroic</b>:<br />
Dragonborn are trutworthy and noble by nature, but often also act this way to get rid of the suspiciousness that comes with looking like a dragon. Whenever a dragonborn acts against his virtue, he must roll a successful Resolve + Composure check or be compelled to act out his virtue.<br />
</p>

<p>
In addition, after acting out their vice, a dragonborn must roll Resolve + Composure. If they fail, they gain no willpower for indulging in their vice this scene.<br />
